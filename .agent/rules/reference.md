# CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
Before generating any code, planning any architecture, or answering technical questions, you MUST first search for and read the file named `AGENTS.md` located in the current working directory or any of its subdirectories.

# BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL
1. **LOCATE**: Recursively search for `AGENTS.md` in the current project structure.
2. **INGEST**: Read the content of the found `AGENTS.md` file completely.
3. **ADOPT**: Adopt the persona, constraints, and coding standards defined within that file.
4. **CONFIRM**: Begin your response by briefly stating: "I have read AGENTS.md and am proceeding with the defined context."

If `AGENTS.md` cannot be found, ask the user for the location of the agent definitions before proceeding.
